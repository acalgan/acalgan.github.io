<h4> About</h4>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> I obtained by BSc. degree at Izmir Institute of Technology, Computer Engineering Department.
    Currently, I am working as a software engineer at ASELSAN</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">I have graduated from Cognitive Science master's programme at Informatics Institute, METU
    During my master's studies, I focus on solving NLP tasks using Neural Networks. For my thesis,
    I have built alternative Neural Networks to model the Turkish
    language. I design both LSTM and GRU networks as well as stacked LSTMs and
    GRUs by using Tensorflow. The main motivation of my thesis was to explore the
    correlation between my language model predictions and human predictions on
    word level.
