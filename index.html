<h4> About</h4>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> I graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Computer Engineering Department at Izmir
    Institute of Technology. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at ASELSAN</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">I have obtained an MSc degree in Cognitive Science at Informatics Institute (METU).
    During my master's study, I focus on solving NLP tasks using Neural Networks. For my thesis,
    I have built alternative Neural Networks to model the Turkish
    language. I design both LSTM and GRU networks as well as stacked LSTMs and
    GRUs by using Tensorflow. The main motivation of my thesis was to explore the
    correlation between my language model predictions and human predictions on
    word level. Further details can be found in <a href="https://acalgan.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> section.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"> I also wanted to share my knowledge about language modeling by creating repo on Github.
     In <a href="https://github.com/acalgan/Language-Modeling-Using-Deep-Learning">this repo</a>, papers about different language modeling approaches are presented.
