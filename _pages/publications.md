###### [Prediction of words in Turkish sentences by LSTM-based language modeling](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/89662/12626308.pdf)
For my master thesis, I focus on language modeling. I have built alternative Neural Networks to model the Turkish language. I designed both LSTM and GRU networks as well as stacked LSTMs and GRUs by using Tensorflow. I have done series of experiments such as generating sentences, word prediction, sentence ending prediction. However, main motivation of my thesis was to explore the correlation between my language model predictions and human predictions on word level. I compared my model's word predictions with human's predictions which have been gathered on an independent cloze test experiment.


###### [Team ReadMe at CMCL 2021 Shared Task: Predicting Human Reading Patterns by Traditional Oculomotor Control Models and Machine Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.17.pdf)
We have participated the CMCL 2021 Shared Task. The goal was to predict human eye movements while reading.
